I love the internet, but don't get me wrong, I love my family, sports, and friends more than anything in the world. That being said, nothing challenges and motivates me as much as the tasks I seek out on the web. This constant cycle of challenge, failure, learning, and eventual success has had me addicted since I first discovered what GitHub was.

There's a great quote from one of my favorite books by Kurt Vonnegut, [The Sirens of Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan), and it goes as such: **"I was a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all."** As much as I respect the renowned author, I find myself disagreeing with him. We make our path through life, and with hard work and [perseverance](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/) we can rise and not be so-called "victims".

If you've read this far, I sincerely appreciate your interest. I hope you're as excited as I am about building something groundbreaking together. If you'd like to explore more of my work, feel free to check out my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@0xSiliconShark) channel or my incoherent daily yaps on [X](https://x.com/0xSiliconShark)!

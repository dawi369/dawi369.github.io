I love the internet, but don't get me wrong, I love my family, sports, and friends more than anything in the world. That being said, nothing challenges and motivates me as much as the tasks I seek out on the web. This continuous cycle of challenge, failure, learning, and eventual success fuels my passion for solving complex problems and has had me hooked since I first discovered what [GitHub](https://github.com/dawi369) was.

There's a great quote from one of my favorite books by Kurt Vonnegut, [The Sirens of Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sirens_of_Titan), and it goes like this: **"I was a victim of a series of accidents, as are we all."** As much as I respect the renowned author, I find myself disagreeing with him. We make our own path through life, and with hard work and [perseverance](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/) we can rise and not be so-called "victims". 

Now, to the meat and potatoes of the about section, I hope the appetizer was enjoyable. I will be graduating in the summer of **2025** from the **Czech Technical University in Prague**. My studies have taken me to some very interesting places so far, but the most memorable one was my internship with [Pablo Dylan](https://www.pablodylan.com/#:~:text=Fortitude%20EP%20Out%20Now.%20Home;%20Listen;) in the beautiful and steep hills of [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles#:~:text=Los%20Angeles,%20[a]%20often%20referred%20to%20by) (If the name Dylan sounds familiar, that's because he is the grandson of the world-famous Bob Dylan). If you follow the link, you'll see Pablo's music page, but notice how the most recent music is from over 3 years ago. Pablo put music aside to focus on his quantitative trading algorithms and made his fortune there. He is very active in the machine learning world, usually juggling multiple private and government projects at a time, and that's why my internship with him and his team was so valuable. My internship in Los Angeles has not only taught me how to collaborate on machine learning projects with a team, it sparked my interest in [deep learning focused on financial forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04811#:~:text=This%20review%20delves%20deeply%20into%20deep) and gave me direction like I've never had before. It also gave me invaluable hands-on experience with advanced machine learning models. Since my time in Los Angeles, I've been experimenting with industry-standard tools and tech stacks, researching and reading the latest papers on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/#:~:text=arXiv%20is%20a%20free%20distribution%20service%20and), and battling [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting#:~:text=Overfitting%20is%20the%20use%20of%20models%20or). 

I have since returned to Europe to finish my studies and chase exciting opportunities. I plan to remain in Europe to pursue quality internships and a Master's degree in Machine Learning, with a specialization yet to be chosen. In the meantime, I will continue to develop my skills and hone my strengths in the data science and AI fields. I also enjoy playing ice hockey to keep the bones strong, and I am eager to join companies that value the skill set I provide.

If you've read this far, I sincerely appreciate your interest. I hope you're as excited as I am about building something groundbreaking together.

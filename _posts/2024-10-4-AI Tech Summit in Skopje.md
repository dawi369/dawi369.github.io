## I wouldn't be suprised

If you had no idea where Skopje even is, or if you've even heard of it! The capital of North Macadonia sits sungly in the heart of the Balkan region.

I managed to score free tickets to the even ($300 for standard tickets!!) by cantacting a founder from TBM Group, an event planning company, and giving my pitch to why I should be there. Lucky for me I'm a decent salesmen.

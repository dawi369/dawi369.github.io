## I wouldn't be surprised

if you had no idea where Skopje even is, or if you've even heard of it! The capital of North Macedonia sits snugly in the heart of the Balkan region.

I managed to score free tickets to the event ($300 for standard tickets!!) by contacting a founder from TBM Group, an event planning company, and giving my pitch as to why I should be there. Lucky for me, I'm a decent salesman.

I enjoyed most of the speakers and got some really good insight from a particular PhD student named [Christopher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-plachetka-42b325115/). He is working on deep learning and maps. His model (in real time) cross-references live footage with footage taken before and can accurately update even the smallest differences!
